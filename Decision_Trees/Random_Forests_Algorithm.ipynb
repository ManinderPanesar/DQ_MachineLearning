    "To get familiar with the decision trees ML algorithm, I will be working with income dataset, looking at individual income in the United States. The data is from the 1994 census, and contains information on an individual's marital status, age, type of work, and more. The target column, or what we want to predict, is whether individuals make less than or equal to 50k a year, or more than 50k a year.\n",

In other words, the tree will ideally split the labels into distinct groups with as little mixture possible. This'll allow the splits to give our tree more predictive power.\n",

Although each individual decision tree in a random forest varies widely, the average of their predictions is less sensitive to the input data than a single tree is. This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of 100 or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise. The signal will be the same across all of the trees, whereas each tree will hone in on the noise differently. This means that the average will discard the noise and keep the signal.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the random forest algorithm is incredibly powerful, it isn't applicable to all tasks. The main strengths of a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very accurate predictions - Random forests achieve near state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks. Along with neural networks and gradient-boosted trees, they're typically one of the top-performing algorithms.\n",
    "- Resistance to overfitting - Due to their construction, random forests are fairly resistant to overfitting. We still need to set and tweak parameters like max_depth though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main weaknesses of using a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They're difficult to interpret - Because we're averaging the results of many trees, it can be hard to figure out why a random forest is making predictions the way it is.\n",
    "- They take longer to create - Making two trees takes twice as long as making one, making three takes three times as long, and so on. Fortunately, we can exploit multicore processors to parallelize tree construction. Scikit allows us to do this through the n_jobs parameter on RandomForestClassifier. We'll discuss parallelization in greater detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these trade-offs, it makes sense to use random forests in situations where accuracy is of the utmost importance; being able to interpret or explain the decisions the model is making isn't key. In cases where time is of the essence or interpretability is important, a single decision tree may be a better choice."
